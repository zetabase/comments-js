# [Comments.js](https://zetabase.io/comments-js): easy-setup comments for static sites
 
ðŸ¤™ Yessir, it finally exists: a free, open-source, easy-to-integrate, no-backend-needed commenting system for static sites hosted anywhere.

Comments.js is the easy, extensible way to add a comments section to any website, including static sites like those hosted with GitHub Pages.

## Getting started

Making an account and dropping the HTML snippet into your page ([tutorial here](https://zetabase.io/blog-post/setting-up-comments-on-jekyll-github-pages)) will take five minutes flat.

Comments.js is built atop [Zetabase](https://zetabase.io), a cloud-native database built specifically to enable frontend developers to build data-driven web applications with no backend. This means you can extend and customize Comments.js as your business grows and requires more specialized features.

## Benefits

1. **It works anywhere**: GitHub Pages, Wix, Wordpress, whatever. Take your users â€” and your comments â€” with you when you change hosting.
2. **Super-simple setup**: just follow our simple 3-step guide. It only takes 5 minutes to setup comments on a new site.
3. **100% open and extensible**: Comments.js is 100% open-source and is based on Zetabase. Build freely! No vendor lock-in allowed.
